# Banner Style Web Application
Assignments 1-3 for Web Application Architechture at MSU Denver

This is a Banner-like web application in Ruby on Rails that can be used to mananage courses, professors, students, sections and enrollments. Authentication was implemented with devise. Search, navigation, validation, and styling were all coded by me.
