# Banner Style Web Application
_Assignments 1-3 for Web Application Architechture at MSU Denver_

This is a Banner-like web application in Ruby on Rails that can be used to mananage courses, professors, students, sections and enrollments. Authentication was implemented with devise. Search, navigation, validation, and styling were all coded by me.

## Screenshots of the application in action:

### A professor's 'show' view which includes their course sections and enrolled students:
